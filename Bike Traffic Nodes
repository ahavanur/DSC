#To better understand the traffic patterns within the city, we constructed a network, using the stations as nodes and edges to denote a trip between two stations. More heavily weighted edges mean that more people are travelling between those two stations, giving us a better sense of where the riders are headed. Coupled with the subsetting previously done, it also allows us to see where specific groups are more likely to go.
